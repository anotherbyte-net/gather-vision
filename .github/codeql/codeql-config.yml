# For the interpreted languages that CodeQL supports
# (Python, Ruby and JavaScript/TypeScript), you can restrict code scanning to files in
# specific directories by adding a paths array to the configuration file.
# You can exclude the files in specific directories from analysis by
# adding a paths-ignore array.
paths-ignore:
  - ./.venv
